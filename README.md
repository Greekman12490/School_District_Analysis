# School District Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis

Since we helped Maria with the analysis of the school district, the board saw some discrepancies and/or dishonesty with certain data entries. They requested Maria of this and wanted to get to the bottom of this. She in turn, requested help to modify the code to remove any nulls and see how the district performed with the removed data. As you read further on, you will see the difference.
